# SocialNetworkAnalysis

A community in large networks is a group of nodes in which the proportion of edges is greater than the betweenness of edges. The study of community detection is a standard problem in analyzing large and complex social networks. In this project, we analyze large social networks using different hierarchical clustering algorithms. Every algorithm uses different approach to detect communities, and thus underlying structure of those communities differs. We apply these algorithms and compare the resulting communities based on modularity measure, centralities, local bridges, and community structure. Modularity is ratio of intra-community links to the inter-community links. For accurate communities, this measure is high. The algorithms we implement are Girvan-Newman algorithm based on edge betweenness, Louvain Method, Label Propagation, Random Walks, and Fast Greedy approach to detect communities. We also compare these algorithms based on their accuracy and efficiency.
